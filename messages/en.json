      "description": "Before diving into the world of coding, I was a psychologist, navigating through hospitals and working directly with patients. Surprisingly, those early days laid the foundation for much of my current career. They gifted me with a unique perspective and a set of soft skills that are invaluable in the fast-paced world of programming. Communication is king, whether it's collaborating with colleagues or tech leads, mastering the art of giving and receiving feedback is essential. Driven by curiosity, a trait that's always been a part of me, I embarked on a self-taught journey into programming during the Covid era. It was like discovering a new universe within my own, and I decided to make a complete 180-degree turn. Armed with my projects, I set out to find a job, landing my first gigs where I learned on the fly. Remote work in the programming realm gave me the freedom to pursue another passion: traveling. I found myself relocating to Australia, working for a homegrown Aussie company. After indulging in a 5-month adventure across Asia, followed by a blissful reunion with family in Buenos Aires for 2 months, I decided to settle in Europe, Spain, to dive back into the world of tech.",
